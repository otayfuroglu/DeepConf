# Welcome to DeepConf!

DeepConf is a new tool leveraging ANI-ML potentials to explore low-energy conformational space of small molecules. It is particularly useful for generating bioactive conformers using machine learning-based geometry optimization. 
The tool has been tested with RDKit, TorchANI, and Gaussian16, and is suitable for preparing input geometries for docking or MD simulations.

DeepConf is an automated pipeline for generating and optimizing ligand conformers using ANI (ML), G16 (QM), or UFF (MM). It is designed to support high-throughput ligand processing and is inspired by workflows like DeepQM.
Please see the documentation below.

‚úÖ Requirements
‚Ä¢ Conda with Python ‚â• 3.8
‚Ä¢ RDKit
‚Ä¢ ASE
‚Ä¢ TorchANI
‚Ä¢ PyTorch (‚â• 0.4.1)
‚Ä¢ Optional: Gaussian16 (G16) if QM optimization is required

üí° We recommend using a GPU for faster optimization with ANI-ML potentials.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

conda create --name DeepConf python=3.8
conda activate DeepConf
conda install -c conda-forge numpy tqdm rdkit ase pytorch torchani
conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas tqdm ase pytorch torchani dftd3-python

# For G16 support:
Ensure Gaussian16 is installed and g16 command is available in your $PATH

Download the code:
git clone https://github.com/otayfuroglu/DeepConf.git

üöÄ How To Use 
runConfGen.py is the main script for generating and optimizing conformers.
runConfGen.sh is for run runConfGen.py with parameters

1. Create a working directory:
mkdir <workdir>   #Make a folder called workdir.
cd <workdir>	 #Enter the <workdir> file.

mkdir <structures>  #Inside it, create a structures folder.

2. Copy ligand files:
cp /path_your_files/*.sdf /path/workdir/structures #Add all your .sdf or .pdb files into workdir/structures.

3. Copy the run script:
cp /path/DeepConf/runDeepConf.sh /path/workdir #Copy runDeepConf.sh from the DeepConf folder into workdir.

4. Edit the script:

In run_deepconf.sh, set the correct paths to your Python binary and DeepConf directory.
ligPrep_DIR="/home/path/DeepConf/" #Go to DeepConf directory and run "pwd" and write the path here
PYTHON_DIR="$HOME/path/bin" #Write the path when you run the code "which python" until the bin
struct_dir=structures  #Write your directory that consist structure files

5. Run the workflow:
Go to workdir, and run:
bash runDeepConf.sh
